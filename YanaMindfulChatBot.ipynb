Take a few minutes each day to write down things you're thankful for, as research consistently shows that it helps improve mood. Remember, journaling doesn't have to bring about dramatic changes, but every little bit counts during these troubling times. Find a quiet space where you can reflect and write freely, allowing your thoughts and emotions to flow onto the pages. Consider setting aside a specific time each day for journaling to make it a consistent practice. Finally, remember that journaling is a personal choice, so choose a style or approach that feels most helpful to you.\n"
